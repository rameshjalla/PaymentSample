# Payment Gateway

Payment Gateway validates requests, stores the card information and forwards the payment requests to the acquiring bank. The response of the payment is responded back to the merchant including a unique identifier and the status of the payment processing.

The Bank Service simulates a payment authorization based on a default payment policy that defines the allowed currencies, min/max allowed amount.
